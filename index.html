  <h1>Gardening and Back to School... Fall is here!</h1>
  <p>
    Nothing tastes better than food you grow yourself. Homegrown vegetables are fresher,
    and have way more flavor compared to anything you can buy at the store.
    In the summer, my favorite activity is picking cucumbers stright from the vine, and hearing a nice crunch as I bite into it. There's a pefect texture and flavor that a 
    supermarket just can’t match. The same goes for peppers; when I grow
    them myself, they come out more unique than anything packaged at a store.
    For me, gardening isn’t just about growing food. It’s about getting flavors that are
    impossible to find anywhere else. You can't explain it!
  </p>

  <h2>Why I Love Gardening</h2>
  <p>
    Gardening is relaxing for me. It is rewarding care for them, and then pick vegetables
    later in the season. Giving them to friends and family is my favorite part! Cross breeding peppers is one of the more interesting
    things I’ve learned about, since it lets me creat the funkiest looking peppers that don’t exist in stores.
    Whether successful or not, I enjoy the process. I start in mid February, and go through October. This is my favorite time of the year!

  <h2>Besides Gardening, what else do I like to do... Hiking!</h2>
  <p>
    I love hiking, especially when the garden is out of season. Below is an image that I took in Utah. Can you believe the rock formation?
